Purchasing a property in Singapore is the largest investment of most buyers’ lifetimes. That decision must be carefully considered – many factors weigh on the value of a property, such as the district of the property, the type of the property, and the age of the development. In addition, many investors intend to rent their house out as a form of passive income, or to cover their monthly mortgage payment. Savvy investors will also need to consider the resale value of their properties in the future. 

Investors have these three questions before they decide to invest in a property:

* Which property provides the highest capital appreciation?
* Which property can I reasonably finance?
* What are the main factors behind a property's rent and resale value?

Our aim was to aid potential landlords and investors of properties in *Singapore* to **easier analyze and pick properties** that provide the *highest rate of returns*.

This project is a course-work in "DBA3702 Descriptive Analytics with R" created by Liu Qizhang. 

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Provides a geospatial view of historical property price appreciation across districts
- **Statistical Analysis**: Allows users to freely create their own visualizations and understand the relationships between property attributes
- **Find Property**: Helps users locate properties that suit their needs and provides a predicted rent price, enabled by machine learning.
- **Mortgage Calculator**: Allow users to easily calculate their required monthly payments. They can compare it with the above predicted rent price and make better financing decisions.

## To Do

We aim to achieve the following in future iterations:

* Improve linear modelling accuracy
* Acquire larger and more descriptive datasets on rent prices to enable better time series analysis
* Scrape hyperlinks to sales listings and allow user to be redirected from 'Find Property'

## The Code of Project 

The code is written in R using Shiny.
